        <h2>How do I play Osu?</h2>
        The default keys are the left and right mouse buttons and the Z and X
        keys, which can be modified in the settings. The circles that appear
        on the game screen are called strike circles. When the circle outside
        the strike circle shrinks and falls just on the strike circle, click
        on the strike circle. Some circles have a slider that you need to hold
        down and follow as it moves. When a large disk appears on the screen,
        press and hold a button and quickly rotate your mouse around the
        center of the circle.

        <h2>The cursor movement seems to be delayed?</h2>
        Try enabling the hardware cursor in settings, which can reduce cursor
        input latency. However, in some operating systems or browsers,
        problems such as flickering or the inability to display the cursor may
        occur, so it is turned off by default. In addition, the cursor size
        adjustment of the current hardware cursor only has 3 fixed levels. The
        minimum value is displayed below 0.65, and the maximum value is
        displayed above 0.95.

        <h2>The game is stuck, what should I do?</h2>
        It may be that the browser itself consumes a large amount of
        resources, causing the lag, or it may be that some strange mechanism
        causes the browser to reduce the frequency of event sending. It is
        recommended to avoid excessive CPU usage, close anti-virus
        software/computer manager like Avast, try closing other tabs of the
        browser and restart the browser. Please make sure you are using a
        mainstream modern browser (such as Chrome, Firefox, or MS Edge). If
        it's still stuck,

        <h2>Why is nothing displayed on the web page?</h2>
        It may be that our API, <a href="https://osu.sayobot.cn">SayoBot</a>
        , is having issues. If so, you can contact the developers of Mino for them to fix it.

        <h2>Can I upload beatmaps locally?</h2>
        You can not upload beatmaps here. We get all of our beatmaps from the osu database, upload your own beatmap to
        osu for it to (eventually) show up here.
