The circles that appear on the game screen are called strike circles. When the circle outside the strike circle shrinks and falls just on the strike circle, click on the strike circle. Some circles have a slider that you need to hold down and follow as it moves. When a large disk appears on the screen, press and hold a button and quickly rotate your mouse around the center of the circle.</div><div class=faqentry><h2>The cursor movement seems to be delayed?</h2>Try enabling the hardware cursor in settings, which can reduce cursor input latency. However, in some operating systems or browsers, problems such as flickering or the inability to display the cursor may occur, so it is turned off by default. In addition, the cursor size adjustment of the current hardware cursor only has 3 fixed levels. The minimum value is displayed below 0.65, and the maximum value is displayed above 0.95.</div><div class=faqentry><h2>The game is stuck, what should I do?</h2>It may be that the browser itself consumes a large amount of resources, causing the lag, or it may be that some strange mechanism causes the browser to reduce the frequency of event sending. It is recommended to avoid excessive CPU usage, close anti-virus software/computer manager like Avast, try closing other tabs of the browser and restart the browser. Please make sure you are using a mainstream modern browser (such as Chrome, Firefox, or MS Edge). If it's still stuck, <a href=https://github.com/WebOsu-2/webosu-2.github.io/issues/new>please file an issue on our github page</a>.</div><div class=faqentry><h2>Why is nothing displayed on the web page?</h2>It may be that our API, <a href=https://osu.sayobot.cn>SayoBot</a> , is having issues. If so, you can contact the developers of Mino for them to fix it.</div><div class=faqentry><h2>Can I upload beatmaps locally?</h2>You can not upload beatmaps here. We get all of our beatmaps from the osu database, upload your own beatmap to osu for it to (eventually) show up here.</div><div class=faqentry><h2>What should I do if the audio and/or video are out of sync?</h2><a href=https://github.com/WebOsu-2/webosu-2.github.io/issues/new>Please file an issue on our github page</a></div><div class=faqentry><h2>I have other problems not shown here.</h2><a href=https://github.com/WebOsu-2/webosu-2.github.io/issues/new>file an issue on our github page</a></div></div></div>
